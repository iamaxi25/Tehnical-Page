                    <h2>What is "Looking for Alaska"?</h2>
                </Header>
                <p>Looking for Alaska is John Green's first novel, published in March 2005 by Dutton Juvenile. Based on his time at Indian Springs School, Green wrote the novel as a result of his desire to create meaningful young adult fiction.[1] The characters and events of the plot are grounded in Green's life, while the story itself is fictional.[1]</p>
                <p>Looking for Alaska follows the novel's main character and narrator Miles Halter, or "Pudge," to boarding school where he goes to seek a "Great Perhaps," the famous last words of François Rabelais.<br><Br> Throughout the 'Before' section of the novel, Miles and his friends Chip "The Colonel" Martin, Alaska Young, and Takumi Hikohito grow very close and the section culminates in Alaska's death.<br><br> In the second half of the novel, Miles and his friends work to discover the missing details of the night Alaska died. While struggling to reconcile Alaska's death, Miles grapples with the last words of Simón Bolívar and the meaning of life, leaving the conclusion to these topics unresolved.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Looking for Alaska is based on John Green's early life. Growing up, Green always loved writing, but when it came to his middle school experience, he classified life as a middle schooler as "pretty bleak".[6]<br><br> As a student, Green describes that he was "unbearable" to parents and teachers; however, he always worked hard to fit in with his peers.[1] Green's situation did not improve after his transition to high school, so he asked his parents if he could attend Indian Springs School, a boarding school outside of Birmingham, Alabama. His parents agreed, and he spent the remainder of his time in high school at Indian Springs School forming valuable relationships with teachers, relationships that Green says still exist today.</p>
                <p>During a book talk at Rivermont Collegiate on October 19, 2006, Green shared that the idea of Takumi's "fox hat" in Looking for Alaska originated from a Filipino friend who wore a similar hat while playing pranks at the school.<br><br> He also noted that his inspiration for the possessed swan in Culver Creek derived from a similar swan he remembers at Indian Springs. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at school, but Green emphasizes that while the setting is based on his life, the novel is entirely fictional.[8]</p>

                <p>Miles Halter, a teenage boy obsessed with last words, leaves his normal high school in Florida to attend Culver Creek Preparatory High School in Alabama for his junior year. Miles' reasoning for such a change is quoted by François Rabelais's last words: "I go to seek a Great Perhaps."[10] Miles' new roommate, Chip "The Colonel" Martin, nicknames Miles "Pudge" and introduces Pudge to his friends: hip-hop emcee Takumi Hikohito and Alaska Young, a beautiful and emotionally unstable girl.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Pudge and Lara have a disastrous date, ending with a concussed Pudge throwing up on Lara's pants. Alaska and Pudge grow closer and he begins to fall in love with her, although she insists on keeping their relationship platonic because she has a boyfriend at Vanderbilt University named Jake, whom she insists that she loves.</p>

                <p>Looking for Alaska is divided into two halves named 'Before' and 'After' as in before and after Alaska's death, and are narrated by main character Miles Halter. Rather than the typical numerical system, each chapter is denoted through the number of days before Alaska's death or the number of days after. The genesis of this structure resulted from John Green's influence of public reactions to the events on September 11, 2001.[12][13] In an interview with Random House Publishing, Green recalled that newscasters stated that people would now view the world through the lens of either before or after 9/11.[12]</p>
                <p> Green says in the same interview, “We look back to the most important moment in our history, and that becomes the dividing line between what we were and what we are now. So I wanted to reflect on the way we measure and think of time.”[12] For the characters in Looking for Alaska, Alaska's death proved a life-altering moment, and Green wanted to reflect this importance by creating the structure of the novel around the axis of Alaska's death.[12]</p>

                <p>Looking for Alaska is classified as "young adult fiction".[12] While Green used his own life as a source of inspiration, the novel itself is entirely fictional. In an interview with Random House Publishing, Green states that the intended audience for the novel is high-school students.[12]</p>
                <p>In a separate interview, Green comments that he wrote the novel intending it to be young adult fiction because he wished to contribute to the formation of his readers’ values in a meaningful way.[14] Furthermore, themes of sex, drugs, alcohol, first love, and loss classify the book as young adult fiction.[15]</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Miles Halter</h4></li>
                    <p>Miles Halter is the novel's main character and narrator, who has an unusual passion in learning famous people's last words. He transfers to the boarding school Culver Creek in search of his own "Great Perhaps." He is nicknamed "Pudge" by his roommate because he is tall and skinny. Miles is attracted to Alaska Young, who mostly does not reciprocate his feelings. As seen through interactions with other characters, Miles can be categorized as independent and curious, but also unique.[16]</p>
                    <li><h4>Alaska Young</h4></li>
                    <p>Alaska is a wild, unpredictable, beautiful, and enigmatic girl with a sad backstory who captures Miles' attention and heart. She acts as a confidante to her friends, frequently assisting them in personal matters, including providing them with cigarettes and alcohol. She is described as living in a "reckless world." After receiving an unknown call, Alaska dies in a car accident, and the second half of the novel focuses on uncovering the mystery from the night she died. At the end of the book, it is not confirmed whether her death was an accident or suicide.</p>
                    <li><h4>Chip Martin ("The Colonel")</h4></li>
                    <p>Chip "The Colonel" Martin is five feet tall but "built like a scale model of Adonis".[17] He is Alaska's best friend and Miles' roommate. He is the strategic mastermind behind the schemes that Alaska concocts and in charge of everyone's nicknames. Coming from a poor background, he is obsessed with loyalty and honor, especially towards his beloved mother, Dolores, who lives in a trailer.</p>
                    <li><h4>Takumi Hikohito</h4></li>
                    <p>Takumi is a gifted Japanese emcee and hip-hop enthusiast and friend of Alaska and Chip. He often feels overlooked in the plans of Miles, Chip, and Alaska. Towards the end of the novel he returns to Japan.</p>
                    <li><h4>Lara Buterskaya</h4></li>
                    <p>Lara is a Romanian immigrant who is Alaska's friend and becomes Miles' girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, and eventually girlfriend again. She is described as having a mild accent.</p>
                    <li><h4>Mr. Starnes</h4></li>
                    <p>Mr. Starnes is the strict Dean of Students at Culver Creek, nicknamed "The Eagle" by the students. He is pranked by Miles, Chip, Alaska, Lara and Takumi multiple times throughout the novel.</p>

                </Header>
                <p>After Alaska's death, Pudge and Colonel investigate the circumstances surrounding the traumatic event. While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession with finding answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel.</p>
                <p>When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the "Great Perhaps,'" meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar from the University of Northern British Columbia Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life.[18]</p>

                <p>The film rights to the novel were acquired by Paramount Pictures in 2005. The screenplay was potentially going to be written and directed by Josh Schwartz (creator of The O.C.)[4] but, due to a lack of interest by Paramount, the production had been shelved indefinitely.[42] It had been reported that Paramount was putting the screenplay in review due to the success of the film adaptation of John Green's breakout novel, The Fault in Our Stars.[citation needed] On February 27, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, screenwriters for Temple Hill Entertainment who had worked on adaptations for The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns, would be writing and executive producing for the film.[43]</p>
                <p>Paramount was actively casting the latest version of the screenplay, which was written by Sarah Polley.[44][45] Rebecca Thomas was set to direct.[46] Green also confirmed that Neustadter and Weber were still involved with the film.[47] In August 2015, it was announced filming would begin in the fall in Michigan.[48] It was later announced that filming would begin in early 2016 because of lack of casting decisions. Later in 2016, Green announced in a Vlogbrothers video and on social media that the film adaptation had once again been shelved indefinitely.[49] Green explained, "It has always fallen apart for one reason or another."[50]</p>

                </Header>
                <p>Positive reviews of Looking for Alaska have been attributed to Green's honest portrayal of teenagers and first love.[31] The novel's review in The Guardian describes the story's honesty, writing that "the beauty of the book is that it doesn't hide anything."[15] Others cite Green's success as a result of his candidness in portraying death, loss, and grief. In a journal article titled “Although Adolescence Need Not be Violent..,” scholars Mark A. Lewis and Robert Petrone comment on the novel's ability to portray loss in a format relatable to high-school readers.[25] They write that many teenagers experience loss throughout adolescence and Green's portrayal of real characters aids in this relatability.[25]</p>
                <p>Additionally, many educators and librarians recommend Looking for Alaska to their students because of the powerful themes it addresses.[26] Don Gallo, English teacher and editor for the English Journal writes that Looking for Alaska is “the most sophisticated teen novel of the year.”[26] As a result of these reviews, Looking for Alaska appears on many recommended reading lists.</p>
